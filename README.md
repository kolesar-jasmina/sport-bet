# Sports/Game Prediction App

This app uses machine learning and AI models to make predictions for various sports or games. It provides users with updated information about upcoming games and predictions for which team is likely to win.

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)._

## Getting Started
To get started with the app, follow these steps:

* **Clone this repository** to your local machine
* **Install the necessary** dependencies using `npm install`
* **Run the app** using `npm start`
* Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Features
* Todays Games table updated daily using JavaScript's setInterval function
* Two AI models: XGBoost and Neural Network
* Predictions for which team is likely to win based on both models
* Percentages indicating the chance that the green team will win based on each model respectively

**More about The XGBoost and Neural**

The XGBoost and Neural Network models used in this app are both machine learning models commonly used in predictive modeling. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a decision-tree-based algorithm that uses gradient boosting to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It has gained popularity in recent years due to its efficiency and effectiveness in solving complex regression and classification problems.

The Neural Network model, on the other hand, is a type of artificial neural network that is modeled after the structure of the human brain. It consists of multiple interconnected layers of nodes that process information in a non-linear way, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in data.

In this app, both models are trained using historical data on various sports or games. The trained models are then used to predict the outcome of future games based on a set of input features such as team rankings, player statistics, and weather conditions. The predictions are presented to users along with the percentage indicating the chance that the green team will win based on each model respectively.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
