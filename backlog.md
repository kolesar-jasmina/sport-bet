[] Add a comprehensive description of the app in README.md
    hint: First see what packages we have, how are they configured and used, what views and components we have and try to run the app locally and play around
    hint: check how apps are described in readme files in other git projects by other ppl using similar tech stack.
    pomoc prijatelja: bitno je da razumes sta se ovde radi. sta ces da napises kao description i nije bas bitno. bitno je da ima napisan tech stack, bitni paketi i kako se setapuje da tera na local-u. salj poruke ako zakucas, al moj topli savet je da prvo piatas chatGPT-3 pa tek onda mene.
[] Add a history component - basically DataTable for todays games but with different data structure (historical data should be paginated and searchable)
[] Add a comment component - users can post comments on games
[] Add a "like" component - users can like or dislike games
[] Refactor DataTable to have collapsable sections and add Comment component as a new column and like as well for todays games table
[] Fill collapsable sections with real-world data (twitter sentiment, google searches, bing AI...) - think about this...
[] Hide Evaluation Values from todays games table, but make it visible on some button click (maybe table should expand to the right on right edge click?)
[] user can track his bets accros history see his balance
